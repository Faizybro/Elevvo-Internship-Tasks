## 🚀 Tasks Overview

### 🔹 Level 1

* **Task 1: Student Score Prediction**
  Built a regression model to predict student exam scores based on study hours and lifestyle factors. Implemented data cleaning, visualization, and evaluation of linear & polynomial regression.

* **Task 2: Customer Segmentation**
  Applied K-Means clustering on Mall Customers dataset to segment customers by income and spending score, with visualizations of clusters and experimentation with DBSCAN.

---

### 🔹 Level 2

* **Task 3: Forest Cover Type Classification**
  Developed multi-class classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict forest cover type using environmental features. Compared models, tuned hyperparameters, and visualized feature importance.

* **Task 4: Loan Approval Prediction**
  Built a binary classification model to predict loan approval outcomes. Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and addressed class imbalance with SMOTE. Evaluated models using precision, recall, and F1-score.

* **Task 5: Movie Recommendation System**
  Implemented a user-based collaborative filtering system using the MovieLens dataset. Recommended movies based on similarity scores and evaluated performance with Precision\@K. Extended with item-based filtering & SVD.

### 🔹 Level 3

* **Task 6: Music Genre Classification**
  Built a deep learning-based classification model to predict music genres from audio features. Preprocessed dataset, extracted features (MFCCs), and trained neural networks.

* **Task 7: Sales Forecasting**
  Applied time series forecasting techniques (ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future product sales. Explored trend, seasonality, and residual components with visualizations.
